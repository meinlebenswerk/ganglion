# ganglion

TL;DR: A very basic deep learning library for JS/TS

## What is Ganglion?
The name ganglion describes a collection of neurons, sometimes referring to the nerve-clusters that form insect-brains. 
Basically ganglions ar to the human brain what this machine learning library is to other deep-learning software ;)

This library is intended to be very easy to use as well as understand, for simple (Node or other) JS-based Ml-Experiments.

Currently the only real Application for this Library is Artificial Evolution guided Neural Nets.
Specifically for this purpose there are methods for mutating and breeding networks.
As of yet nothing fancy like backpropagation is supported...

basically a shallow-learning library
